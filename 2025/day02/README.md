# Day 02: Gift Shop

I used a Python Morsels exercise to solve this one: [`parse_ranges`](https://www.pythonmorsels.com/exercises/008c3f7419944ed781eb4924483bff35/).

I re-implement `parse_ranges` from scratch and ended up using a hack that Ned Batchelder calls a [Python gargoyle](https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/201802/a_python_gargoyle.html).

It took a few seconds to run, but I'm fine with that. Why over-engineer to clean up after a mischievous elf's one-time mishap?
