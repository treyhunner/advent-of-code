I'm not very interested in the "check the surrounding rows and columns" challenges.
I rarely encounter this kind of thinking in my own work.

I enjoyed me use of the walrus operator in part 2.

I initially thought that my solution for part 2 was far too slow because my code was hanging.
It turns out I was just stuck in an accidentally infinite loop.
